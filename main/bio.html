    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
    <h3>Earliest Moments</h3>
      <p>Roz Chast was born in Brooklyn, New York. She grew up in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, the only child of George Chast, a high school French and Spanish teacher who subscribed to The New Yorker, and Elizabeth, an assistant principal in an elementary school. Her Jewish parents were children during the Great Depression, and she has spoken about their extreme frugality. She graduated from Midwood High School in Brooklyn and attended Kirkland College. Thereafter, she attended the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating with a B.F.A. in painting in 1977. After graduating in 1977 she returned to New York City, where she quickly established her cartooning career. Her cartoons and covers have appeared continuously in The New Yorker since 1978.</p>
    <h3>A Look into Chast’s Designs</h3>
      <p>Chast's subjects often deal with domestic and family life. In a 2006 interview with comedian Steve Martin for the New Yorker Festival, Chast revealed that she enjoys drawing interior scenes, often involving lamps and accentuated wallpaper, to serve as the backdrop for her comics. Her comics reflect a "conspiracy of inanimate objects", an expression she credits to her mother.</p>
      <p>Her first New Yorker cartoon, Little Things, was sold to the magazine in April 1978. The cartoon, which Chast describes as "peculiar and personal", shows a small collection of "Little Things"—strangely-named, oddly-shaped small objects such as "chent", "spak", and "tiv". Chast's drawing style shuns conventional craft in her figure drawing, perspective, shading, etc.; this approach is similar to that of several other female cartoonists, notably Aline Kominsky-Crumb and Lynda Barry. A significant part of the humor in Chast's cartoons appears in the background and the corners of the frames.</p>
    <h3>Career Overview</h3>
      <p>She has published several cartoon collections and has written and illustrated several children’s books. Her work has appeared in numerous magazines through the years, including The Village Voice, National Lampoon, Scientific American, Harvard Business Review, Redbook and Mother Jones, but she is most closely associated with The New Yorker.</p>
      <p>Her New Yorker cartoons began as small black-and-white panels, but increasingly used more color and her work often appears over several pages. Her first cover for The New Yorker was on August 4, 1986, showing a lecturer in a white coat pointing to a family tree of ice cream.</p>
    <h3>A Closer Look</h3>
      <p>She has written or illustrated more than a dozen books, including Unscientific Americans, Parallel Universes, Mondo Boxo, Proof of Life on Earth, The Four Elements and The Party After You Left: Collected Cartoons 1995–200. In 2006, Theories of Everything: Selected Collected and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006 was published, collecting most of her cartoons from The New Yorker and other periodicals. One characteristic of her books is that the "author photo" is always a cartoon she draws of, presumably, herself. The title page, including the Library of Congress cataloging information, is also hand-lettered by Chast.</p>
      <p>Her book Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant? is a graphic memoir, combining cartoons, text, and photographs to tell the story of an only child helping her elderly parents navigate the end of their lives.<p>
      <p>She is represented by the Danese/Corey gallery in Chelsea, New York City.</p>
